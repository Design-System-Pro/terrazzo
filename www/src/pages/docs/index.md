# Terrazzo (Beta)

Terrazzo is a suite of tools to help you build and manage design tokens:

## Tokens Lab (coming soon!)

Create a `tokens.json` file either by forking your favorite open source design system, or create it from scratch using color & typography tools. Look forward to a beta release in June 2024!

## CLI

Generate any code (CSS, JS/TS, Sass, JSON, Tailwind, etc.) using a <abbr title="Design Tokens Community Group">DTCG</abbr> format `tokens.json` file. Previously known as Cobalt. [See docs](/docs/cli).

## Components

React components for building and managing design systems:

- [React Color Picker](/docs/components/color-picker): pick colors using the latest formats like OKLCH, in pixel-perfect color reproduction using WebGL.
- [Tiles DS](/docs/components/tiles): A suite of React components to showcase your design system docs.
