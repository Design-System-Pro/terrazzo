# Plugins

Plugins let you **generate code** from `tokens.json`. Here are all current plugins available:

- [@cobalt-ui/plugin-css](/docs/plugins/css): Generate `.css`
- [@cobalt-ui/plugin-js](/docs/plugins/js): Generate `.js`, `.ts`, and `.json`
- [@cobalt-ui/plugin-sass](/docs/plugins/sass): Generate `.scss` or `.sass`

_Note: @cobalt-ui/plugin-ts and @cobalt-ui/plugin-json were merged into @cobalt-ui/plugin-js_

## Creating Plugins

Cobalt was designed to be easy to create plugins within minutes. View the [developer guide to creating plugins](/docs/guides/plugins) to learn more.
