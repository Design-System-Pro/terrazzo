# About Cobalt

## Project Goals

The project goals are subject to change, but currently are encompassed by 3 points:

1. Support the complete and full [W3C Design Tokens CG spec](https://design-tokens.github.io/community-group/format)
2. Maintain a pluggable interface, where users can write their own plugins or the community can contribute plugins
3. Make syncing from Figma easy and automatable

## Why the name “Cobalt”?

The name **Cobalt** has three meanings:

1. Cobalt is an [element on the periodic table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt) in reference to design tokens being the “atoms” of design systems.
2. Just as blue pigment (cobalt or ultramarine) was [the last “missing piece“ in paint colors](https://artuk.org/discover/stories/colour-in-art-a-brief-history-of-blue-pigment), having an easy-to-use system to manage design tokens aims to be the “missing piece” to design management.
3. Blue is also a reference to a [blueprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueprint) that acts as the reference for a design system.
